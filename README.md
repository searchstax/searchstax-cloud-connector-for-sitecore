### PaaS/Scaled Instructions
# Best Practice/Recommendation:
Apply these changes via your CI/CD pipeline using secure environmentally unique tokens/variables
Every Sitecore Web Instance (CD/CM) needs:
1. Web.config - <AppSettings> - <add key="search:define" value="Solr"/> - set to Solr
2. App_Config/ConnectionStrings.config <add name="solr.search" change the value of connectionString.

Every XConnect Instance needs:
1. App_Config/ConnectionStrings.config - <add name="solrCore" change the value of connectionString.
2. App_Data\jobs\continuous\IndexWorker\App_Config\ConnectionStrings.config - <add name="solrCore" change the value of connectionString.
3. Use the Schema API and upload App_Data\solrcommands\schema.json to both XDB Collections - reference: https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/8_6/schema-api.html
